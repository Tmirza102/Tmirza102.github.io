      <h3>Muhammad mirza</h3>
      <p>My name is Muhammad Talha Mirza and I am a student studying Computer science at City Unviersity. I have had little experience with coding back when I studied  computer science as a GCSE learning languages like python and creating small quizzes uisng else and if statements.
         I then went onto study A level- Maths , Physics and Biology and still had an interest in computer science , however I did not take the subject. Initally I wanted to study a Physics Bsc and then changed my mind and went for a Comp sci bsc as I aspired to be a software enginner
         or have my own tech company. My knowledge and understanding has since developed through many modules such as Databases , System Architecture , Programming in Java and many more.

    <h3>Java 2D game</h3>
    <p>
	The end of this module has concluded with a 2D java game that i have created using a sophisticated physics engine .
        This project demonstrates my comprehensive understanding and increased my skills of the use of encapsulation , general coding
        and the foundations of building a game. I created a sonic game similar to the 90's game, where the player can interact with
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	with bodies such as enemies and pickups . The player cna collide and will have a stat counter and will need to pick up all the rings to 
        to the next level. The game also consists of special moves that will allow sonic to move faster and jump higher . Theres a setting menu and a keybinds
        to pause the game and hidden menus where you can move the volume up and down . The win the game , youll have to collect all the emeralds across all three levels.
